In the examples subdirectory, you will find example snapshots for the
different hydro codes supported with Powderday. This will likely
change significantly over time as the code gets cleaned up, the
parameter files change, and the example snapshots migrate toward the
Agora snaps.  But, in the mean time, this should hopefully get you started.

For each example file there should be two parameter files that will be
reasonable for the associated snapshot.

To run, type (in your source directory):\\
\begin{verbatim}
 > python pd_front_end.py <example directory> <parameters_master_file> <parameters_model_file>
\end{verbatim}
Note - the .py extensions on the parameter files need to be left off.  So, as an example for the {\sc gadget} \ snapshot detailed below:
\begin{verbatim}
 > python pd_front_end.py examples/gadget parameters_master parameters_model
\end{verbatim}

\section{Gadget}

The {\sc gadget} file here is an idealized disk galaxy (actually
created with {\sc gizmo} but the outputs are the same).  The snapshot
can be downloaded here:
