1. speed up the grid processing - at the least, consider doing a p.map
of the particle_smooth by doing a simple domain decomposition.  one
could also imagine doing the same for the octree construction by
splitting up the T/F's of the base grid to different proceessors since
they don't talk to one another, so long as they re-join the same list
in the same order.

look at some pool.map tutorials for this online.

2. be sure to write out the dust grid when smoothing the particles

3. lay out the star particle grid from the grid generation.  make this
a separate function from the octree construction as it isn't dependent
on the octree construction (and can be done very quickly with
pfh_readsnap)


3. set up hyperion to run just on this, and test with some images and seds.

4. put the FSPS SEDs into the stellar particles
