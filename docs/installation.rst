Installation
============

We're working on an all-in-one installer for powderday.  For the time
being, for better or worse, the installation of individual packagesa
that powderday depends on is manual. Here, we'll detail the order of
operations, though it's always wise to check the parent site for
installation.

yt
--------------

First and foremost, you need to have `yt <http://yt-project.org>`_
installed.  There are many ways to do this (as directed on the `yt
<http://yt-project.org>`_ project website.  Utilizing `anaconda
<https://store.continuum.io/>`_) is certainly a good option
because (a) it comes with all of the required python subpackages,
and (b) the `yt <http://yt-project.org>`_ installation is
exceptionally easy then.
