THINGS TO INCLUDE IN INSTALLATION

1. dust files

=========================================
TROUBLE SHOOTING
=========================================


1. If you have errors installing python-fsps:

1.a make sure you have the latest version of fsps installed 

1.b  If there's an error with -fPIC in building python-fsps, then try
include that flag in the FSPS makefile.  You can do this by adding
-fPIC to the F90FLAGS in the Makefile for FSPS, i.e.

>F90FLAGS = -O -cpp -fPIC

1.c to install python-fsps, you need to have f2py installed.  this
comes with the yt installation, but is named f2py2.7 and is in:

/Users/desika/yt-x86_64/bin

so, simply go to that directory and do:

> ln -s f2py2.7 f2py

1.d also you need to go to yt-x86_64/lib/python2.7/site-packages  and do

>ln -s numpy/f2py/ f2py



2. Compiling Hyperion:

2a.  if you get an error "ld: library not found for -lcrt1.10.5.o" and
you run mac os x, it could be that you have issues with the command
line tools installation (especially with mavericks).  if you run
mavericks, do:

>sudo xcode-select --install

and wait 30 minutes while it downloads and installs command line tools!
