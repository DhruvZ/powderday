TROUBLE SHOOTING
=========================================


1. If you have errors installing python-fsps:

1.a make sure you have the latest version of fsps installed 

1.b  If there's an error with -fPIC in building python-fsps, then try
include that flag in the FSPS makefile.  You can do this by adding
-fPIC to the F90FLAGS in the Makefile for FSPS, i.e.

>F90FLAGS = -O -cpp -fPIC

1.c to install python-fsps, you need to have f2py installed.  this
comes with the yt installation, but is named f2py2.7 and is in:

/Users/desika/yt-x86_64/bin

so, simply go to that directory and do:

> ln -s f2py2.7 f2py
