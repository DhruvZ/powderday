Welcome to Powderday!  

Powderday is a dust radiative transfer package designed to interface
with galaxy formation simulations in order to produce spectral energy
distributions, as well as realistic images.  The code utilizes FSPS
(and its python hooks) for stellar SEDs, and Hyperion for dust
radiative transfer.  Threaded throughout is yt.

The code has two principle aims - to be flexible (and extremely
modular), and to be easy to use.  The package is written in python,
though makes use of fortran, C and cython.  

As of now, the code works principally for Gadget, Gizmo and other
variants.  Support for Gasoline, RAMSES, ART and Enzo are planned
however.

For further instructions, please see the installation guide, and
ever-evolving user manual in the src/docs.
